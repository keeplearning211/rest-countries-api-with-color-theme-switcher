## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for building user interfaces
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - A powerful and easy-to-use routing library for React application
- [Redux toolkit query](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks#fetching-data-with-rtk-query) - A data fetching and caching library that simplifies common cases for loading data in a web application. RTK Query is built on top of the Redux Toolkit core and leverages RTK's APIs like createSlice and createAsyncThunk to implement its capabilities.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- [Mui](https://mui.com/) - A powerful and versatile React component library that can help you build beautiful and user-friendly React applications
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool for faster and leaner development

### What I learned

- I learned how to customize styles within a React app using the [MUI](https://mui.com/) library. This included leveraging MUI's theming capabilities to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application, using its responsive design system to ensure the app looks great on all device sizes, and utilizing its pre-built components to speed up development time.
